Bob's 40th Birthday Extravaganza
================================

So I'm turning 40 in September and it seems like a perfect excuse to go to Vegas! 
I hope we can find a hotel and a weekend that works for everyone. If you want to 
invite other people please feel free. Here are the details:

I would really like to bet on some NFL games so that means we would go on the 
second or third weekend in September (12-13 or (19-20). I will probably fly out 
on Saturday morning and leave on Monday, but you all can choose to come in on 
Friday night if you wan't more gaming action.

I am leaning towards the 19-20th as it seems the second weekend has a few 
cheaper hotel options for some reason. I have stayed at a bunch of places in 
Vegas and like to stay on the strip, however the Westgate 
(formerly Hilton, formerly LVH) has a really good sports book with really 
lax rules on drink comps. The sports books on the strip require you to have 
$100 tickets on a game to get drinks or give you a couple coupons which is lame. 
The 'superbook' on the other hand is off the strip and thus they need to keep 
people coming in. There is also a monorail station at the hotel so we can easily 
get to the strip on Saturday (it runs until 3am so if we do stay out too late 
we'll have to cab it back)

We also don't have to all stay at the same place so here are some options:
