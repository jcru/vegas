Bob's 40th Birthday Extravaganza
================================

So I'm turning 40 in September and it seems like a perfect excuse to go to Vegas! 
I hope we can find a hotel and a weekend that works for everyone. If you want to 
invite other people please feel free. Here are the details:

:Dates: September 19th - 20th
:Location: TBD (more below)

Option 1: Westgate $100/person
------------------------------

I have stayed at a bunch of places in 
Vegas and like to stay on the strip, however the Westgate 
(formerly Hilton, formerly LVH) has a really good sports book with really 
lax rules on drink comps. The sports books on the strip require you to have 
$100 tickets on a game to get drinks or give you a couple coupons which is lame. 
The 'superbook' on the other hand is off the strip and thus they need to keep 
people coming in. There is also a monorail station at the hotel so we can easily 
get to the strip on Saturday (it runs until 3am so if we do stay out too late 
we'll have to cab it back)

Option 2: Vdara / Monty Carlo $200/person 
------------------------------------------

We can get 5 people in a hospitality
suite so it would be about $230 a person. The other option at the Vdara is a
King bed with a queen sleeper sofa, so 3 people could do one of those rooms too.
We can also mix-in a few rooms at the Monty Carlo which is connected by a tram
to the Vdara and use the Suite as the home base which will cut down on the
amount of bed sharing going on.
