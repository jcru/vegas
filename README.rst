================================
Bob's 40th Birthday Extravaganza
================================

So I'm turning 40 in September and it seems like a perfect excuse to go to Vegas! 
I hope we can find a hotel and a weekend that works for everyone. If you want to 
invite other people please feel free. Here are the details:

:Dates: September 19th - 20th
:Location: `Golden Nugget`_ (downtown vegas)

Hotel
=====

The famous `Golden Nugget`_ in downtown vegas. They have a really good Sports book for the sunday games and
is on the Fremont Street experience. So we can hop around to the various casinos to get our craps and blackjack 
on. They also have a kick ass pool if we get tired of all the gaming.

Flights
=======

Flights aren't looking too bad there are a few direct flights and many with one stop for less. It woudl be great if we can all try to show up at the same time. I'm leaning towards the 940 arrival as it gives more time to setup for the night.

Southwest AUS to LAS
    * 1279  820am - 940am : $193
    * 2954  205pm - 300pm : $193

Southwest LAS to AUS
    * 445 725pm - 1205am : $193
    * 357 500pm - 1230am : $172 <- one stop but I'll probably take it as I have points to cover.
